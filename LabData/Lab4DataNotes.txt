Known Start Hardware (try 1), ended x = 17.5 from end, y is 13.5 from top
Should be x,y = 64.13, 15.6
y is good, off in x direction (should be closer to 1.01m)?

Known start Hardware (try 2), ended x = LEN - 16.5 in, y = 15.25in
Should be x,y = 103.7 cm, 11.3cm
Was x,y = 105.3cm, 13.72cm

Random start hardware x = LEN - 19 in, y = 12.5 in
Should be x,y = 97.32cm, 18.25 cm
Was x,y = 98.29cm, 14.92cm
