  a. Driving straight (error is dTheta)
  b. Rotating (error is dS)

1a. Camera Testing
  a. Set up Apparatus
  b. Write script with movements
  c. Process data
  d. Scripts to analyze data

2. Testing straight driving
  a. D = 0:5:0.5
  b. P = -25, 25, -50, 50, -75, 75

3. Testing rotation
  a. theta = 30 deg increments
  b. direction = +1, -1
  b. P = -75, -50, -25, -10, 10, 25, 50, 75



Lab 2 Todo List
---------------
Software:
  1. Write code for backwards alpha-setting.
  2. Move rampup to Arduino.
  3. Design a PID controller.

Tests:
  1. Tick rate (alternative to alpha values)
    a. Write up experimental procedure.
      i. ***** Write software for procedure.
    b. Identify right encoder tick rate (at various speeds).
    c. Identify left encoder tick rate (at various speeds).

  2. Identify alpha values (potentially valuable, maybe can skip?)
    a. Decide speeds, rotations to test.
    b. Run tests at desired speeds, trajectories

  3. Track robot motion with camera.
    a. Set up apparatus with webcam from lab, 80/20, tape
    b. Write a list of trajectories to measure.
      i. ***** Encode these trajectories within a script.
    c. Identify how to use the software.
    d. Process all the video data.
    e. Analyze the data.
      i. ***** Make graphs of all the trajectories.

  4. Design PID controller
    a. Identify PID controller coefficients.


Robot Hygiene Todo List
-----------------------
2. Clean up wiring.
5. [Less important] Reduce skywiring.
6. Make Teensy board more stable.

Lab 3 Todo List
---------------
-- 1. Machine metal strips for the side sensors.
3. Wire side sensors, verify that they work.
4. [For next lab] calibrate side sensors


Todo Sunday night:



Error List
----------
ERROR? WHEN TICK RATE IS 0 IN TRANSITION, MAY HAVE ERRORS!



Next Steps:
5. Write code to be able to hit enter to start alpha-tests
  a. Expand alpha-test for backwards (both directions)
6. Debug alpha-test script
7. Write code to automate alpha test script (have pause button/distance check in case it hits something?)
8. Run alpha tests

-- 9. Design ramp-up curve for non-jerky acceleration.

10. Design test apparatus for straight line testing.
  a. Take one speed, do representative curve at all distance, for others, do 1-2
  b. Focus on long-term behavior after first characterization
11. Debug test apparatus for straight line testing.
  a. Take one speed, do representative curve at all distance, for others, do 1-2
  b. Focus on long-term behavior after first characterization

12. Design test apparatus for rotation testing.
13. Debug test apparatus for rotation testing.
