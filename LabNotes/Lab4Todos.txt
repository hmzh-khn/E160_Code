Goals:
------
1. Show a working particle filter in simulation.
2. Show a working particle filter on robot.

Lab 4 Todos:
------------

Hardware
========
1. Calibrate distance sensors
2. Recharacterize error in wheels (to use as normal dist. parameters)
3. Update calibration for ticks -> centimeters
  a. Use and implement new encoder resolution


Software
========
1. Change resampling boundary
2. Estimate uncertainty
3. Momentum weighting (recent good measurement, kept around)


Tests (test all with camera tracking)
=====
0. Hardware for camera?
1. Known start, simulation
2. Random start, simulation
3. Known start, hardware
4. Random start, hardware
5. Test robot kidnap problem
